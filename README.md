# Understanding `va_list`, `va_start`, and `va_arg`

This repository is dedicated to exploring the internal workings of `va_list` and related macros in C (`va_start` and `va_arg`). Through this project, we visualize and analyze how these macros manage variable-length arguments and investigate key concepts such as:

- The behavior of `va_list` struct elements during execution.
- Differences between `floating_arguments` and `general_arguments`.

## Objectives

- Understand the underlying mechanism of `va_list` and its macros.
- Observe how the structure changes with each argument access.
- Highlight distinctions between floating-point and general arguments in variadic functions.
- Provide a clear visualization of the internal processes.

## Key Features

- **Code for visualization**: Step-by-step exploration of how `va_list` interacts with variable arguments.
- **Detailed comparisons**: Analyze how floating-point and general arguments are handled differently.
- **Educational focus**: Ideal for those curious about low-level behavior in variadic functions.
