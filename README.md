This repository is dedicated to :

- The behavior of `va_list` struct elements during execution.
- Differences between `floating_arguments` and `general_arguments`.

## Objectives

- Understand the underlying mechanism of `va_list` and its macros.
- Observe how the structure changes with each argument access.
- Highlight distinctions between floating-point and general arguments in variadic functions.
